# NLP

Deciphering human language using Machine Learning
-------------------------------------------------

Duration:
----------
3 hours (including break)
Pre-requisite:
This is an advanced machine learning course. To benefit from this course the participants are expected to have:
1.	Understanding of supervised and unsupervised machine learning 
2.	Knowledge of python, or a high-level programming language like Java or C#.
3.	Using jupyter Python notebook environment

Description:
------------

In this hands-on course using Python, we will learn how to use machine learning for Natural Language Processing (NLP) through interactive notebooks. Natural Language Processing (NLP) is a field that covers computer understanding and manipulation of human language. Machine learning is a branch of Artificial Intelligence that focuses on the ability to automatically learn from existing information. Language processing uses models that attempt to understand and represent the information at various levels that includes morphology, syntax, semantics, pragmatics and discourse. In this training, we will learn how to use machine learning to build these models. 

This training includes the following topics:

1.Representing text as a vector using count, TF-IDF and co-occurrence matrix
2.Detecting similar documents
3.Sentiment Analysis
4.Identifying the themes in a set of documents
5.Extracting the entities and the relationship between the entities (stretch goal depending on time) 

The course will introduce the participants to NLP libraries such as nltk, gensim and Spacy.
